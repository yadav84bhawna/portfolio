        Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves a wide range of
         powerful tools that assist in building intelligent systems.
          Among the most widely used are machine learning and deep learning 
          frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Keras, which 
          allow developers to design, train, and evaluate models efficiently.
